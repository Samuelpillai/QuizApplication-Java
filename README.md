# 📚 Quiz Application – Java Coursework (MSc Cloud Computing)

A modular, scalable, and extensible **Java-based assessment and quiz system** designed and implemented as part of the **Advanced Programming in Java** module in the MSc Cloud Computing program at Newcastle University.

This project showcases object-oriented design, interface-driven architecture, design patterns, defensive programming, and extensive unit testing using JUnit.

## ✅ 1. Key Features

- **Factory Design Pattern** – For creating quiz questions, quizzes, and student entities  
- **Interface-Based Design** – Enables modularity and future extensibility  
- **Defensive Programming** – Validates inputs and maintains system robustness  
- **Free-Response & Multiple-Choice Questions** – Handles validation, formatting, and multiple correct answers  
- **Student Statistics Tracking** – Tracks scores, attempts, averages, and revision eligibility  
- **Revision Quiz Generator** – Based on student’s incorrect responses  
- **JUnit Tests** – Covers factories, scoring, student objects, and edge cases

## 🚀 4. How to Run the Application

> This application runs as a **command-line (CLI)** program. You can run it via IntelliJ or any Java IDE.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuizApplication.git
   cd QuizApplication

	2.	Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
	3.	Run the following file:

src/Model/QuizSystem.java



⸻

✅ 5. Running the Unit Tests

All tests are written using JUnit 5 and are located in the src/JunitTesting/ directory.

Main Tests:
	•	FactoryTest.java – Factory creation tests
	•	QuestionTest.java – Free-response and multiple-choice answer validation
	•	QuizSystemTest.java – End-to-end quiz execution
	•	StudentStatisticsTest.java – Performance tracking
	•	StudentTest.java – Identity and detail verification

Tests can be run directly in your IDE or through a build system (e.g., Maven, Gradle if integrated).
